In the 13 bouts for UFC 300, there are 12 competitors who have held a UFC belt at some point in their careers, which is a great selling point to hawk a pay-per-view (for $79.99 in the United States with an ESPN+ subscription) and also a timely indication of how tough it is to win a championship and to squeeze it for all the stardom it can bring.

Alex Pereira, the defending light heavyweight champion, worked his way to headline status in a heavier division after setting himself up as a foil to Israel Adesanya, one of the sport's biggest stars. Zhang Weili had to recover from dual losses in 2021 to solidify her as the sport's most prominent fighter from China, and now faces Yan Xiaonan's bid for her belt and bragging rights in their home country.

Justin Gaethje and Max Holloway became fits for the BMF belt ‚Äî the affectionately (and profanely) titled informal strap that seems to be mostly an excuse to give fan favorites five rounds to entertain instead of three ‚Äî by building reputations for action-packed striking (and very little defense).

Even the first fight on the card ‚Äî not the pay-per-view, the earliest preliminary card ‚Äî features the former flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo moving to bantamweight for Cody Garbrandt, the former champion there who has been trying for years to get his career rolling again.

Here's a look at the full card for UFC 300:

Main card (10 p.m. ET, ESPN+ PPV)

Alex Pereira (9-2-0) vs. Jamahal Hill (12-1-0), men's light heavyweight championship, five rounds

Zhang Weili (24-3-0) vs. Yan Xiaonan, women's strawweight championship, five rounds

Justin Gaethje (26-4-0) vs. Max Holloway (25-7-0), BMF belt, men's lightweight, five rounds

Charles Oliveira (34-9-0) vs. Arman Tsarukyan (21-3-0), men's lightweight, three rounds

Bo Nickal (5-0-0) vs. Cody Brundage (10-5-0), men's middleweight, three rounds

Prelims (8 p.m. ET, ESPN and ESPN+)

Jiri Prochazka (29-4-1) vs. Aleksandar Rakic (14-3-0), men's light heavyweight, three rounds

Calvin Kattar (23-7-0) vs. Aljamain Sterling (23-4-0), men's featherweight, three rounds

Holly Holm (15-6-0) vs. Kayla Harrison (16-1-0), women's bantamweight, three rounds

Sodiq Yusuff (13-3-0) vs. Diego Lopes (23-6-0), men's featherweight, three rounds

Dana White pledges to raise bonuses for UFC 300 from $50K to $300K

Dana White scored plenty of points among fighters and fans when he pledged this week to increase the bonus possibilities for great knockouts and great fights to $300,000 from the usual $50,000 per award.

White made the promise during a news conference. "Done," he replied when asked about raising the bonuses. There were cheers and plenty of laudatory tweets by fighters, including Conor McGregor, who is working his way back from a leg injury.

"Life changing money for many on the card," McGregor said.

The timing of the increase is curious because UFC 300 is not just a milestone card, it's the first pay-per-view since UFC's parent company, Endeavor, announced that it had settled two class-action lawsuits related to fighter pay. UFC is expected to pay the fighters $335 million to settle the lawsuits, the company said in a regulatory filing.

The fighters who filed the lawsuit said they expected to say more about the settlement once the details are worked out with the court, which could take up to two months.

Mixed martial arts fans are in for a treat when UFC 300 lands in Las Vegas on Saturday. The card is stacked with big names from the prelims all the way through the main event.

That main event sees Alex Pereira defend the light heavyweight championship against former champion Jamahal Hill. Pereira is a former middleweight champion who won the vacant light heavyweight championship with a stoppage of Jiri Prochazka in November. In Hill, Pereira is facing a man who did not lose the title in the Octagon, instead being forced to vacate the title after suffering an ACL injury in a basketball game.

Weili Zhang will also be defending her women's strawweight championship when she faces Yan Xiaonan, who enters the title fight on the momentum of back-to-back wins. In addition, the ceremonial "BMF" title will be up for grabs in a highly anticipated lightweight bout between Justin Gaethje and Max Holloway.

Even the prelims are loaded up. The featured prelim could secure a title challenger for the main event when light heavyweights Jiri Prochazka and Aleksandr Rakic collide. Former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling is set to make his featherweight debut when he takes on Calvin Kattar. Two-time Olympic gold medalist Kayla Harrison is set for her promotional debut when she takes on former bantamweight champ Holly Holm. And the first bout on the card sees a pair of former champs meet when Deiveson Figueiredo battles Cody Garbrandt at bantamweight.
